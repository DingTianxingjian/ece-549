##### Description

 I use exactly zero mean normalized cross correlation as my similarity functions, and I also use 3 columns to calculate similarity value.

```python
    for current_offst in range(-offst, offst + 1):
        start_idx = max(0, -current_offst)
        end_idx = min(img1.shape[0], img2.shape[0] - current_offst)
        if end_idx > start_idx: 
            # pixel_number = end_idx - start_idx + 1
            # diff = img1[start_idx:end_idx, 0] - img2[start_idx + current_offst:end_idx + current_offst, -1]
            # sum_double = np.sum(diff ** 2) / pixel_number
            distance = 0
            for i in range(3):
                A = img1[start_idx:end_idx, i]
                B = img2[start_idx + current_offst:end_idx + current_offst, -1-i]
                mean_A = np.mean(A)
                mean_B = np.mean(B)
                norm_A = A - mean_A
                norm_B = B - mean_B
                numerator = np.sum(norm_A * norm_B)
                denominator = np.sqrt(np.sum(norm_A ** 2) * np.sum(norm_B ** 2))
                zncc = numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else 0
                distance += 1 - zncc / (i+1)
            if distance < min_dist:
                min_dist = distance
                min_offst = current_offst
```

I firstly used 3 columns together to calculate ZNCC. However, I realized that similar pixels calculated ZNCC should have a higher weight, and then it turned out to be correct.
